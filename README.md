## Lessons Learned
I learned how to round to the nearest decimal place. 
I also learned that instead of using math.round or math.floor in each scope
I can set a variable amount *100, and that makes things less confusing.
(hope I worded that right). 
I learned that its a good troubleshooting technique to test a variable 
I'm having issues with by printing it in multiple 
places in my code to see where its going wrong.
